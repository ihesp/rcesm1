<p>The current RCESM system was developed around a coupled Gulf of Mexico configuration to try and repeat the results of the TAMU version of the model as closely as possible. During development of the model, several different component configurations and grid resolutions were tested. This document gives a brief description of these component configurations (compsets) and grids, as well as the machines that are generally supported by the CESM/CIME software used in the RCESM.</p>
<div class="section" id="rcesm-components">
<h2>RCESM Components<a class="headerlink" href="#rcesm-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="available-compsets">
<h3>Available compsets<a class="headerlink" href="#available-compsets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the course of a CESM/RCESM run, the model components integrate forward
in time, periodically exchanging information with the coupler.
The coupler meanwhile receives fields from the component models,
computes, maps, and merges this information, then sends the fields back
to the component models. The coupler brokers this sequence of
communication interchanges and manages the overall time progression of
the coupled system. A RCESM component set is comprised of eight
components: one component from each model (atm, lnd, rof, ocn, ice, glc,
wav, and esp) plus the coupler.</p>
<p>The active (dynamical) components available in RCESM include the WRF atmosphere, ROMS ocean and CLM land model. Because
the active models are relatively expensive to run, data models that
cycle input data are included for testing and spin-up. Stub components
exist only to satisfy interface requirements when the component is not
needed for the model configuration (e.g., the active ocean component
forced with atmospheric data does not need land or glc components,
so lnd and glc stubs are used).</p>
<p>Compsets in CESM/RCESM describe which components are active and their basic configurations for the run. RCESM currently supports four different configurations of WRF, ROMS, CLM and various data or stub components.</p>

<p>Once the model resolution is set, components will read in appropriate
grid files and the coupler will read in appropriate mapping weights
files. Coupler mapping weights are always generated externally in
CESM/RCESM. The components will send the grid data to the coupler at
initialization, and the coupler will check that the component grids
are consistent with each other and with the mapping weights files.</p>
<p>In CESM and RCESM, the ocean and ice must be on the same grid, but the
atmosphere, land, river runoff and land ice can each be on different grids.
Each component determines its own unique grid decomposition based upon
the total number of pes or processing elements assigned to that component.</p>

<li><p class="first">Do you want to use a grid resolution and domain that has already been tested or create a new one?</p>
<p>The RCESM code has been tested and includes support for three different grid/domain sets. These are described in the section above: <a class="reference internal" href="#rcesm-grids">RCESM Grids</a> . If one of these supported grids works for your new application, then you can move on to the next question. If you need to add a new domain or grid, there are several files that will need to be updated with grid information, and you will need several coupler domain and mapping files to support it.</p>

namelist via the namelist generating scripts (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">components/wrf/bld/wrf.buildnml.csh</span></code> and/or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">components/roms/bld/roms.buildnml.csh</span></code>). You may also need to make changes to the ROMS header or namelist files in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">components/roms/Apps</span></code> directory. Once this is all done, you can create an experiment case for your application from which
you can set up your runs. To learn more about creating a case, changing xml variables, and running the model, see the

<p>These websites are older, a bit out of date, and not exactly what we need for our model. Below are more specific instructions for generating the domain and surface dataset files needed for a CESM run that includes CLM.</p>
<p>Step 1: Generate SCRIP grid mapping files for your domain. This can be done with a python script available at TAMU. Contact Jaison Kurian if needed (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:jaisonk&#37;&#52;&#48;tamu&#46;edu">jaisonk<span>&#64;</span>tamu<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>).</p>
<p>Step 2: Create the domain files using the gen_domain tool. This tool is available from many places, and it is not entirely necessary to use the one from an older version of CLM. The version available through CIME in a full checkout of RCESM should work. The tool is located in: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cime/tools/mapping/gen_domain_files</span></code> .</p>
<p>Step 2-a: Build the gen_domain tool using the directions in the INSTALL file that is located in the same directory.</p>
<p>Step 2-b: Run the gen_domain tool using the command:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span> <span class="pre">gen_domain</span> <span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">&lt;input</span> <span class="pre">mapping</span> <span class="pre">file</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">&lt;ocean</span> <span class="pre">grid</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">&lt;land</span> <span class="pre">grid</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;</span></code>
This will produce three domain files, one for the land and atmosphere, one for the ocean and sea ice, and one for the ocean on the atmospheric grid.</p>
<p>Step 3: Create mapping files from the input data sets to the land grid. In order to map the surface data into a file on the land grid, the mapping weights must be generated with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mkmapdata.sh</span></code> script. This is the tool that needs to use a version of CLM that matches the one in the repository.</p>
<p>One way to get this is to checkout an older tag of clm (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">co</span> <span class="pre">https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/trunk_tags/clm4_5_13_r211</span></code>) and build the tool on your machine from its location in that repository (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">components/clm/tools/shared/mkmapdata</span></code>). However, this could require some detailed porting to a new machine, so the easiest way is to use some older versions of this tool that were previously ported from Yellowstone to Cheyenne by the Paleo working group. These are located on Cheyenne at: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/gpfs/fs1/p/cesm/palwg/cesm1_2_0/models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/mkmapdata/</span></code> . The script <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mkmapdata-tamu-gom3x-02.sh</span></code> was successfully used to create the surface data to 3km wrf grid mapping files on April 8, 2019.</p>
<p>Step 3-a: Copy the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mkmapdata-tamu-gom3x-02.sh</span></code> script to a new file and edit it as needed for your new grid and application.</p>
<p>Step 3-b: Make a pbs submission script to submit this job to a compute node on cheyenne. This job takes a while and will need the memory from compute nodes, which is larger than the login nodes. The script should call the mkmapdata.sh script as:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/gpfs/fs1/p/cesm/palwg/cesm1_2_0/models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/mkmapdata/mkmapdata-tamu-gom3x-02.sh</span> <span class="pre">-p</span> <span class="pre">clm4_0</span> <span class="pre">-t</span> <span class="pre">regional</span> <span class="pre">-v</span> <span class="pre">-r</span> <span class="pre">[your</span> <span class="pre">grid</span> <span class="pre">name]</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">[full</span> <span class="pre">path</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">atm</span> <span class="pre">scrip</span> <span class="pre">grid</span> <span class="pre">file]</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&gt;</span> <span class="pre">output.txt</span></code> . It will need 1 CPU and approximately 4 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Step 3-c: Submit the pbs script. You can run <cite>tail -f output.txt</cite> to track the script as it runs. When it is finished, it should have created a mapping file from each input data file grid to your new grid.</p>
<p>Step 4: Create the land surface data file using the mksurfdata_map tool. This is another tool that is useful to have the older version of. Again, you can checkout an older version of clm (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">co</span> <span class="pre">https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/trunk_tags/clm4_5_13_r211</span></code>). The mksurfdata_map tool is located in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">components/clm/tools/clm4_0/mksurfdata_map</span></code> .</p>
<p>Step 4-a: Follow the instructions in the README file to build the mksurfdata_map tool. This worked on Cheyenne without porting the entire clm tag.</p>
<p>Step 4-b: Call the mksurfdata.pl script with user generated grid specifiers as:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span> <span class="pre">./mksurfdata.pl</span> <span class="pre">-res</span> <span class="pre">usrspec</span> <span class="pre">-usr_gname</span> <span class="pre">[your</span> <span class="pre">grid</span> <span class="pre">name]</span> <span class="pre">-usr_gdate</span> <span class="pre">[date</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">mapping</span> <span class="pre">files]</span> <span class="pre">-usr_mapdir</span> <span class="pre">[directory</span> <span class="pre">containing</span> <span class="pre">map</span> <span class="pre">files]</span></code>
This script should run quickly on a login node, and produce four files. Two log files and two netcdf surface data files for CLM.</p>

<h3>RCESM and CESM2 Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#rcesm-and-cesm2-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Scripts for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/cesm/machines.html">supported machines</a> and
userdefined machines are provided with the RCESM and CESM release. Machines are supported in RCESM/CESM on an individual basis
and are usually listed by their common site-specific name. To get a
machine ported and functionally supported in RCESM, local batch, run,
environment, and compiler information must be configured in the CIME
scripts. The machine name “userdefined” machines refer to any machine
that the user defines and requires that a user edit the resulting xml
files to fill in information required for the target platform. This
functionality is handy in accelerating the porting process and quickly
getting a case running on a new platform. For more information on
porting, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://esmci.github.io/cime/users_guide/porting-cime.html">CIME porting guide</a>.  The
list of available machines are documented in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/cesm/machines.html">CESM supported machines</a>.
Running <strong>query_config</strong> with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--machines</span></code> option will also show
the list of all machines for the current local version of
CESM. Supported machines have undergone the full CESM porting
process. The machines available in each of these categories changes as
access to machines change over time.</p>
<p>For the RCESM, three new machines are supported in our version of CIME that may or may not be supported by CESM. These include Ada, Terra and Stampede2.</p>
