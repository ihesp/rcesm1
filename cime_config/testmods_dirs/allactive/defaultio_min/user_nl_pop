! The changes here are needed in order to get restart tests to pass: Without these
! changes, POP outputs a 'once' file at the start of the run, and this causes a mismatch
! between the base and restart runs (because different files exist in each of these
! runs). The changes below do more than just disabling the 'once' file, but since there
! doesn't seem to be an easy way to just disable the 'once' file, we're using these more
! substantial changes.
