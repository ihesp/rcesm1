 for_testing_allow_non_annual_changes = .true.

 ! When we have daily rather than annual glacier dynamics (as we do in this testmod, due
 ! to having test_coupling in user_nl_cism), CLM applies the dynbal adjustments in a
 ! single time step rather than spreading them throughout the year. This can cause
 ! sensible heat fluxes of thousands of W m-2, which causes CAM's PBL scheme to blow up.
 ! So force these fluxes to zero for this testmod; this breaks water and energy
 ! conservation in CLM, but should allow the test to pass.
 for_testing_zero_dynbal_fluxes = .true.
